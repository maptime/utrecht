Come code your maps with us at the first Maptime Utrecht!
The team from Webmapper will provide a workshop to share their hands-on experience in web cartography and geographic web application development.
JavaScript powers most online maps these days. During this evening we'll cover the two primary mapping libraries D3.js and Leaflet.js .

Never written a line of code before? Don't worry! Maptime is for all skill levels! This is what Maptime is all about: a time and space for collaborative learning, exploration, and map creation.
During the workshop, we create an interactive, online map together taking one step at a time! So bring your laptop to join in.
Are you already a seasoned Web developer or geo-specialist well versed in the ins and outs of JavaScript, don't be put off: also for you there might be new inspiration. If printed maps is more your cup of tea, D3 and leaflet are also great tools to prepare your paper maps!
